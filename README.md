# static-cpuminer-opt
This script builds static versions of the following miners:
* cpuminer-opt
* cpuminer-gr
* xmrig
* xmrig-upx

All miners dependencies are also built from source, attempting to use the most performance oriented compilation flags, and even explicitely disabling some security features for performance gains.
